# Linear Regression
Working with machine learning

Least Square “Linear Regression” is a statistical method to regress the data with dependent variable having continuous values whereas independent variables can have either continuous or categorical values. In other words “Linear Regression” is a method to predict dependent variable (Y) based on values of independent variables (X).  It can be used for the cases where we want to predict some continuous quantity. E.g., Predicting traffic in a retail store, predicting a user’s dwell time or number of pages visited on Dezyre.com etc.

A variety of data sets are available at http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/regression.html
